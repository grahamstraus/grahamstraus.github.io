### [DALL.E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)
Openai is known for the large language model GPT-3 which can do almost any natural language task. Recently they have released an API to generate images from text. I entered in a few basic political prompts and below are the results. I have the prompts as headings and the images they made right below.

Here is a code chunk showing how I generated these images. 

```{python, eval = F}
response = openai.Image.create(
  prompt= "Polarized politics",
  n=1,
  size="1024x1024"
)
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']

print(image_url)
